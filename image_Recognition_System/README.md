## About this Project:

Titled "Content Based Indian Foods Recommendation App" is developed by using the dataset, download from kaggle, dataset is available in this repository.

## Steps:

<ol type="1">
  <li>Download Dataset from Kaggle</li>
  <li>Applying Preprocessing on Dataset: Fill null values, remove duplicates, remove unnecessary features and clean dataet.</li>
  <li>Create "tags" feature which contain all tags such as description of food, type of food and recipe of food etc.</li>
  <li>After creating tags, I apply stemming on "tags" column because there are many words such as lovely, loving, lover etc has same meaning as 'love'. It is necessary because next step is based on counting most frequent words of dataset. So, in that situation it is better to apply stemming to count them in one words category.</li>
  <li>Using scikit-learn "count vectorizer" I create vectors that contain most frequent words from the whole dataset.</li>
  <li>Then using scikit-learn "cosine similarity", I calculate similarity of each food with all foods available in dataset. Cosine Similarity range in between [0,1].</li>
  <li>At the end, I import this cosing similarity variable into binary format, and use it in streamlit app.</li>
</ol>
